# Rock Paper Scissors Game

My solution to TheOdinProject's Rock Paper Scissors Challenge. This is V1.0, which does the bare minimum to have the application function.
## To Do's
1. ~~Refactor/Clean Code Base~~
2. Improve UI
3. ~~Remove event listeners when win condition met~~
4. ~~Add reset functionality~~
